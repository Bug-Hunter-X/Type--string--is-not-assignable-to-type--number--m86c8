This repository contains a simple TypeScript program demonstrating a common type error. The `add` and `subtract` functions are defined to accept two numbers and return a number. However, if you try to assign a string to the result variable, you'll get a type error.  The solution demonstrates how to correct this type error by ensuring that only numbers are assigned to the `result` variable.
